# CIMCO (Carrier Inspiration Ministries Coin) - README

## What is CIMCO?

CIMCO (Carrier Inspiration Ministries Coin) is a utility token built on the Stellar blockchain to fund, fuel, and facilitate gospel work. It is the financial engine of a broader Kingdom ecosystem that includes:
	•	PNEUMA Coin – a spiritually symbolic coin reserved for gospel laborers
	•	VESSEL App – a ministry dashboard and dispatch system

CIMCO operates like a pump placed in the river of global markets — drawing value and sending it uphill to ministry workers who serve the gospel on the frontlines.

⸻

## Key Functions
	•	Engages in Market Activity: CIMCO is placed in liquidity pools, trading pairs, and decentralized exchanges.
	•	Creates Economic Pressure: Its market presence creates the value needed to push resources up the hill.
	•	Funds the Ministry Pipeline: Provides the financial force behind the delivery of resources via PNEUMA and VESSEL.

## How It Works

Global Markets (River)
      ↓
  CIMCO (Pump)
      ↓
  PNEUMA (Hose)
      ↓
  VESSEL (Tank + Dispatcher)
      ↓
  Ministry Worker (Spigot)
      ↓
  Gospel Labor (Church Planting, Discipleship, Outreach)

Without CIMCO actively engaging the markets, the rest of the system cannot flow.

## Why It Matters

Ministry workers shouldn’t have to beg for scraps while the world swims in abundance. CIMCO bridges that divide.

It is:
	•	Spirit-led, not speculation-driven
	•	Purpose-built for ministry
	•	Transparent, accountable, and decentralized

CIMCO doesn’t reward holding.
It empowers giving.
It moves value from the hands of the world to the hands of the harvest.

CIMCO is not a speculative asset. It is a Kingdom tool.

“The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few…” – Luke 10:2
